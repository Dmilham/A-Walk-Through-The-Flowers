<h2>The trials and tribulations of Daniel Milham - In 500 words</h2>

<p class="essay">I have been a Technology and Media Consultant professionally for the past ten years. 
<p class="essay">
After high school, I pursued a Network Plus training course, which has paved the way for my career in Technology.</p>
<p class="essay">
For the first half of my career, I was self-employed as a Technology Consultant.  I delivered corporate level network performance in residential sectors on consumer level budgets.    It taught me how to stay vigilant, reliable, and an honorable businessperson.</p>
<p class="essay">
This was a lucrative business for me for about six years.  Unfortunately, there were many consumer technology retail companies rolling out in home and walk in service which, was a large part of my clientele. This was the first time I needed to explore a new career path.</p>
<p class="essay">
I had an opportunity to work for The New York Shipping Association as a Longshoreman.  This job taught me how to be resilient, calculative and, forged endurance. Due to an unfortunate accident, I could no longer maintain employment in that field.  It became apparent that once again I needed to explore a new career path. This time, to pursue something with meaning to me.</p>
<p class="essay">
I have been involved with sound and music for the majority of my life.  Fortunately, as a Media Consultant, I was able to explore the science of sound and turn this passion of mine into a career. I had the opportunity to work in numerous recording studios throughout New York City. I have designed sound for several short films including an award winning short film entitled Alex & Alma which screened at the, Court Metrage short film corner Festival de Cannes 2013. I have also built light suits and sets for an Off Broadway Play, iluminate.  Working in media has given me multiple outlooks on situations and time.  It also has given me some of the most interesting contacts that I have ever encountered in previous industries.</p>
<p class="essay">
One of these contacts saw my abstract thinking towards the IT industry and was enamored by the fact that I would laugh at the problems that his tech team would be crying about for months.  They brought me in as a temporary IT consultant at the company he worked for.</p>
<p class="essay">I now found myself full circle back to where I began.  In this position I was able to break down a problem to it’s root and provide an effective solution.  The theme of my life has been to creatively solve problems.  I have used these skills to solve problems from everyday people to complex companies.  Given the way technology is changing I feel it is the right time for me to change.   My native skills, and previous career background has brought me to a point where development is more attainable for me now then it was before.  The reason why I have chosen to follow it this time is that I found it encompasses all that the other industries have been lacking and that is to create efficiency.  I am eager to see where this path takes me.</p>
